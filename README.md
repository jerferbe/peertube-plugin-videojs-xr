# PeerTube plugin videojs-vr

PeerTube plugin to play 360 content. 

Install the plugin on your instance then enable it per video using the 360 tag. If you need specific projection (available from https://github.com/videojs/videojs-vr#projection) then use 360:projection_name. The plugin has been tested with a Ricoh Theta V, Ricoh Theta Z1 and Insta360Pro with different resolution and bitrates. 

Do make sure that your 360 camera does provide an audio source.
